## üìú Introduction

**EPIC** (**E**xploring on **P**o**I**nt **C**louds) is a lightweight LiDAR-based AAV (Autonomous Aerial Vehicle) exploration framework that directly exploits point cloud data to explore large-scale environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves faster exploration while significantly reducing memory consumption. (Click the image to view the video)

Please kindly star ‚≠êÔ∏è this project if it helps you. We take great efforts to develop and maintain it üòÅ.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Test Environment
* Ubuntu 20.04
* ROS Noetic
* C++17

### üöÄ Quick Start

#### Clone our repository and build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SYSU-STAR/EPIC.git
cd EPIC 
catkin build
```
#### Download dataset 
Download simulation maps from my [Google cloud](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tuoVo8PL1m2cmmufkHpu4e7hK36WhJs3?usp=drive_link), create the folder `MARSIM/map_generator/resource` if it doesn't exist, and move the downloaded maps to this folder.

```bash
mkdir -p MARSIM/map_generator/resource
mv /path/to/downloaded/maps/*.pcd MARSIM/map_generator/resource/
```

#### Run program 
```bash
source ./devel/setup.zsh && roslaunch epic_planner garage.launch
```
Trigger the quadrotor by the `2D Nav Goal` in Rviz.

You can replace `garage` with other maps. We provide three test scenarios: `garage`, `cave` and `factory`.

Our simulation environment is developed based on the GPU version of MARSIM. So if you don't have a GPU, you may need to make some necessary modifications to the simulator.
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

* After launching the program, if the terminal keeps displaying a `no odom` warning, this is likely due to graphics card compatibility issues. Please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/SYSU-STAR/EPIC/issues/6) for solutions.


## ü§ì Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to the following projects, which have provided significant support and inspiration for our work:
- [GCOPTER](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/GCOPTER): A general-purpose trajectory optimizer for multicopters, our local planner is based on it.
- [FUEL](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/FUEL): An efficient framework for fast UAV exploration from which our global planner draws inspiration.
- [MARSIM](https://github.com/hku-mars/MARSIM): A lightweight point-realistic simulator for LiDAR-based UAVs upon which our simulator is built.
- [FALCON](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/FALCON): An efficient framework for fast UAV exploration, from which our method for constructing topological maps draws inspiration.
